 Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
Project
For this assignment, our team was tasks to begin the process of creating a client portfolio. It had to include Responsive design to ensure that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, its essential to demonstrate the ability to create a mobile-first application along with responsive design to an existing application. At the time of the assignment we were only given a limited amount of details on what the client wanted so there will be many changes down the road. The comments were utilized to ensure it can be adequately completed later when the time comes.
